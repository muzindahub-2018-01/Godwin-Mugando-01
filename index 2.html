<h1>STATEMENTS (Complainants and witnesses)</h1>
<a href="#statement">Author</a>



<p>
<ol>
	<li>A statement is a merely story told by a witness of what he saw, did, knows of, or from personal experience can relate.</li>
<li>The statement is a guide to the prosecutor when eliciting the story from a witness when he appears in Court.</li>
<li>The decision of whether to proceed with a charge depends upon the sufficiency of evidence in the statements.</li>
<li>It is essential that
 statements contain all the relevant information set out logically and clearly.</li>
 <li>Ensure that both of you and the witness have the time to do the job properly, <br />statement taking can be very time consuming.</li>
 <li>Don't be in a rush to start, always question your witness first and get the story of what happened firmly in your mind.</li><li>Take notes if you wish.</li>
 <li>Ensure that the facts are put in their correct chronological order,that identities are firmly established, that the days and 
 dates and times are possible and correct.</li>
<li>Don't anticipate facts.</li>
<li> A common fault is writing down what you want the witness to say, rather than allowing him time to tell his own story.</li><br />This result in confusion in court when he gives evidence different to that expected of him.</li>
<li>Do not include hearsay, a person can only attest to something he heard or saw himself. If it is necessary to include hearsay for a particular reason,do so in brackets.</p>
<strong>Statements from juveniles should be taken with their parents or guardians present.</strong>

<h2><u>HOW TO MAKE A STATEMENT</u></h2>

<p class="bluetext">All statements recorded by Police follow basic guidelines.<br />Whilist the content of 
each statement will of course differ,the layout, paragraph length, general appearance and final details will set a pattern.
The top left of the page should show the name of the station and reference number. The top 
right will indicate the statement number.</p><br />The full names of the person giving the statement 
and in the case of an African, his Registration certificate number and district or National Identity card 
number must be included.<br />

<p class="blacktext">In the case of other persons, there should be an indication of his race.<br />The first paragraph will
 contain the residential address and business address and phone numbers. If the witness profession is 
 relevant to the case, include it here.<br />The second paragraph will contain information as to whether 
 the witness the case and how.</p>
The third paragraph is where the story begins. Start with the day, date, time and place.
As a rule, make one point per paragraph.<br/> This makes the prosecutorâ€™s job much easier when he wishes 
to refer to the statement point by point.<br />Continue in this manner until you are in possession of all the facts.
<p>The signature of the witness should follow the last paragraph, thereafter the signature of the recording 
detail and the interpreter.
Final details to be included in the statement are, the date, time and place recorded and languages used.
When recording statement of complaint, bear in mind the essentials that are <br />necessary to prove 
the commission of the offence and check that all necessary data has been included.</p>
